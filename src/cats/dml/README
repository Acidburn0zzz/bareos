This directory contains individual sql queries,

These queries are translated into .inc files into
../ by the following scripts:

create_queryfiles.sh

The .inc files only need to be updated when the queries
are altered or new ones are added.

NOTE:
  * each query must consist of a single SQL statement,
    as more statement, separated by columns (";") need special result handling for MySQL.
