<p>
After installation, the Bareos Director is ready for backup jobs.
Before you continue, you should review the UCR variables
bareos/filestorage, bareos/backup_myself and bareos/max_*_volume*,
to limit the local disk space it uses.
In addition to that, you should also review the Bareos Webui related
UCR variables bareos/webui/console/user1/* and set them to your
needs.
